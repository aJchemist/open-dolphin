Using OpenDolphin.js follows the exact same pattern as for Desktop clients:

* create the view (HTML)
* do the binding (JavaScript)

All the rest happens on the server.

Here is a typical structure of an HTML page that uses OpenDolphin.js
(extracted from link:https://github.com/canoo/open-dolphin/blob/master/subprojects/client-javascript/testsuite/functional/BasicFunctionalTestsJs.html[BasicFunctionalTestsJs.html]) :

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    ..
    <!-- refer to OpenDolphin, see also http://open-dolphin.org/dolphin_website/Download.html -->
    <script data-main="../../js/dolphin/" src="../../libs/require.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
..
<p>view description: html elements are best identified by an id
<div id="instant-update-label">unchanged</div>
..
<script>
    require([ 'opendolphin' ], function (dol) {

        // setting up the dolphin for a null url and not forcing a new session on load

        const dolphin = dol.dolphin(null, false);


        // create a presentation model

        // make an attribute with name, qualifier, and initial value
        const instantUpdateAttribute = dolphin.attribute("instant-update", undefined, "");
        // and put it into a presentation model with no id and no type
        dolphin.presentationModel(undefined, undefined, instantUpdateAttribute);


        // do the binding

        // hold onto the html element to bind against
        const instantUpdateLabel  = document.getElementById("instant-update-label");

        // bind value of attribute to value of instantUpdateLabel
        instantUpdateAttribute.onValueChange(function (event) {
            instantUpdateLabel.innerHTML = event.newValue;
        });

        //..
    });
</script>
</body>
</html>

That's it. The div element with id *instant-update-label* will from now on always
display the value of the *instantUpdateAttribute* no matter how or where (client or server)
it was changed.

You can bind individual HTML elements to attributes and vice versa like in the example above.
But just like for desktop clients, you can also use the model store listener to update
collections, use the dolphin instance to send individual commands, and even use the push listening.

In case that you are using any additional web technology like Angular.js or GWT
you can happily use the view generation and binding facilities of these technologies.
Simply use OpenDolphin attributes as the binding sources or targets.

You will find more information about how to use the OpenDolphin.js features in the
<<Use Cases and Demos>> and in the live demos that are available on the
link:https://klondike.canoo.com/dolphin-grails/[live OpenDolphin.js demos] server.
They show the combination of various features and technologies with cross-linking to all sources.
