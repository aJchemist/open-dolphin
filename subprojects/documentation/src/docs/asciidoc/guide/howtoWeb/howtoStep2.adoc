When we click the "reset" button, the dirty value is replaced by the last known base value and
we make even further use of the bindable dirty state.

We also want the button to be enabled only when there is something reasonable to
do, i.e. when there is some value change in the form. This is a very common requirement
in business applications.

It should appear on your screen like:

Here is how the code to reset looks like:

[source,html]
----
        var resetButton = document.getElementById("reset-button");

        // Bind dirty of dolphin attribute to enable reset button
        instantUpdateAttributePM.onDirty(function (event) {
            resetButton.disabled = !event.newValue;
        });

        // Reset dolphin attribute
        resetButton.onclick = function () {
            instantUpdateAttributePM.reset();
        };
