OpenDolphin
===========

Welcome to the OpenDolphin documentation

.The documentation comes in two parts
The User Guide::
    explains the architecture, the concepts, and possible usages.
    It is like a book that you may want to read to understand what OpenDolphin
    is all about, what drives its design, and how it works in general.

The API Reference::
    lets you quickly look up code snippets that you need when using OpenDolphin in your
    own projects. It is all about the implementation details.

The user guide and the references are cross-linked such that you can always jump back and forth
between the overall picture and how it materializes in the details.
No matter where you start, you can always refer from detailed explanations to its place in the
architecture and vice versa.
