An open dolphin attribute can provide more information and can carry additional state that is automatically updated
and available for binding.

The dirty state is observable such that you can bind against it. As soon as at least one attribute of a presentation model is dirty,
that presentation model is also considered dirty.
Each attribute has a "base" value. When a value is dirty it differs from the base value.

Dirty state can be used to bind and set style to enable actions on the client side for example.
The "disabled" state of an action(button) or element will be the reflect that attribute is dirty.

Below examples show binding dirty status to enable/disable button.
