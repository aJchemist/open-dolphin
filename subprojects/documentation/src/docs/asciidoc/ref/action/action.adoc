When there is the least bit of business logic, it goes into an action. Actions live in controller classes of the server module.
In server side the action will be registered and it will register the command and its command handler to apply the business logic.
In client side commands will be sent to that action.

The common superclass for all actions that need access to the ServerDolphin is DolphinServerAction.

We could register for example an action to save our model into DB.
For this is needed to create and register our action by DolphinServerAction
[source,java]
----
public class SaveAction extends DolphinServerAction {
    final ISaveService service;

    public SaveAction(ISaveService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void registerIn(ActionRegistry actionRegistry) {
        actionRegistry.register(CMD_SAVE, new CommandHandler<Command>() {
            public void handleCommand(Command command, List<Command> response) {
                // convert model and invoke service save
            }
        });
    }
}
